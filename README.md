A simple JavaScript MVC framework. 

The primary reason for creating this was because I needed a way to quickly organize my code without the need of learning a whole new framework. Yes, there are a plethora of frameworks designed to do exactly what I've done, but most are large frameworks which add to your, already existing, application code.

I needed something that would allow me to better organize what I had and easily add to it.
