stress

A simple JavaScript MVC framework. Called stress because the namespace is __. Em dash is commonly replaced with underscores and are typically used "In matters of grave importance", hence the name "stress".

The primary reason for creating this was because I needed a way to quickly organize my code without the need of learning a whole new framework. Yes, there are a plethora of frameworks designed to do exactly what I've done, but most are large frameworks which add to your, already existing, application code.

I needed something that would allow me to better organize what I had and easily add to it.

example.html includes documentation (primarily the __.model.Collection class). The file contains not the only documentation, but also working examples of the Collection useage. The results can be viewed in the console.
